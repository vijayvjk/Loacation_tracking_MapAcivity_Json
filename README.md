# Loacation_tracking_MapAcivity_Json

Its an simple application that extracts the co-ordinates of a location from a JSON file.

It directs the object from a list of fixed starting and destination points.

It uses voice/ speech recognition to make it available for blind people too.

Thanks to Velu sir and Thirumal bro for making this application
